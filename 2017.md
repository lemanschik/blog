# ES_2017
A Collection of my work in 2017 to delete old stuff and write it up


## Projects

- Nils (Nativ Interactive Live streams) i liked streams so much and they helped me to delete so much none working code that i wanted to create a whole set of stream libs and give it my favorit api's today out of 2022 view this was relativ silly while i still want to create such a set in clean ESM I Should merge the Nils and Nikolaos Orgs
- I also invested a lot of time into Stream driven template and Component Systems mainly iterating over Vue, React, DoneJS Canjs, 
  - by the way always was wondering and still do why jquery ui is the best we ever did at last when it comes to time to market
  - also out of 2022 view Object.assign(document.CreateElement) is a good replacement for jquery UI
- The CanJS DoneJS Project got early my attention as it was from the same company that invented Jquery++ 
- Also a lot of Container Development Building and internal details like faster distribution and builds.
- It was a year full of errors like always all over the Ecosystem mainly my attention was on Go, Kubernets, OpenStack and so on
  - Running and producing javascript at scale whith high performance. Let it do stuff like big data pipelines and syncs distributed locking 
- i also improved a lot on the interfaces that waas able to identify and use as common denominator between Polyglot code.
